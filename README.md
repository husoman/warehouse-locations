# warehouse-locations

This is an Analysis of Algorithms Project.<br>
Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Linear Seach algorithms are used.<br>
The program finds nearest K warehouse locations among N warehouse locations.<br>

Expected input file: warehouselocations.txt<br>
Expected command line format: ./program N K algorithmType(IS, MS or LS) x-axis y-axis<br>
Sample: ./program 100000 10 MS 1234 5678<br>

N : Total number of locations to be sorted<br>
K : Number of closest locations to be found<br>
algorithmType : Method to be used to solve the problem (Insertion Sort(IS), Merge Sort(MS) or Linear Search(LS))<br>
x-axis: X-axis information of the point that closest K location will be found<br>
y-axis: Y-axis information of the point that closest K location will be found<br>

The program is tested with GNU C++ compiler in Linux.<br>
Successful output file (output.txt) is achieved.<br>
